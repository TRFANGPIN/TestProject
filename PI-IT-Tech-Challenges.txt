 Create a Node.js Backend application.
 Add the data provided to you in your MongoDB instance.
1).
 -Create a RESTful endpoint(GET API) to retrieve only NAME, PRICE and SPECIFICATIONS from
all the products matching the following queries:
 -Name (Single value – Must Include partial match(searching))
 -Category (Single value query– Exact match)
 -Subcategory (Multiple value query– Match at least one value - Exact match)
 -Inventory (Must be greater than 0 - DEFAULT)
 -Date (DEFAULT SORT – Latest)(Date filter is good to have feature)

Queries on Category, Subcategory, Price and Specifications should work in combination.

1B)(optional) In case of category as a single query parameter, modify the above API to store the
queried results (in step 1) into REDIS for future queries on the same category value to
return data from Redis.
 
2).Lastly, create a 'Place Order' RESTful endpoint(API) to save order details placed by the
customer. The sole purpose of this part of the challenge is to showcase your
thoughtfulness of potential use-cases of an E-Commerce.
